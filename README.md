# SVG Maze Generator and Solver

This project is a maze generator and solver that produces and solves mazes in SVG format.

### Usage

To initialize the project, you need to build it by running the following command:

```bash
$ mvn install
```

### Generating a Maze

To generate a maze, use the following command:

```bash
$ java -jar target/proyecto3.jar -g -s <seed> -w <width> -h <height>
```

- `<seed>`: Seed value for the random maze generation.
- `<width>`: The width of the maze in units.
- `<height>`: The height of the maze in units.

### Solving a Maze

To solve an already generated maze, use the following command:

```bash
$ java -jar target/proyecto3.jar < input.mze > path/to/output.svg
```

- `input.mze`: The input file containing the maze data.
- `output.svg`: The destination file where the solved maze will be saved as an SVG image.

### Example

To generate a maze with a seed of `123`, a width of `10`, and a height of `10`, you would run:

```bash
$ java -jar target/proyecto3.jar -g -s 123 -w 10 -h 10
```

To solve the maze and save it as `solved_maze.svg`:

```bash
$ java -jar target/proyecto3.jar < input.mze > solved_maze.svg
```

### Notes

- Ensure that Maven is properly installed and configured on your system before running the `mvn install` command.
- The `input.mze` file should contain valid maze data generated by the program.
